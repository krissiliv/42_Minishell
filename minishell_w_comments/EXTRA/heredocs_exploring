What are heredocs?

cat >> _testfile       redirects input in append mode
cat << x               reads input until delimiter x is found
                       when delimiter is found it executes the function 
                       also, it saves the read string line by line

cat << o | cat > out


THIS DOESN''T WORK:
cat << h < _testfile >> out
cat << x < _testfile
cat _testfile << x
cat _testfile <<x
