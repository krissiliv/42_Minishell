RANDOM TESTS:
echo $SHELL hello my world $PWD                                                  // tested and OK
grep < _testfile \"r\" > out                                                    //tested and OK
grep "ho" _testfile > out
grep "ho" < _testfile > out


FIXED:
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE CONCERNING THE OUTPUT FOR THE FOLLOWING CMDS:
wc -l _testfile     2                   This command uses input redirection (<) 
                                        to provide the contents of the file (testfile) 
                                        to the wc command.
wc -l < _testfile   2 _testfile         This command takes the file (testfile) 
                                        as an argument directly, without using input redirection.

COMPLEX TESTS
grep -n "!< infile" | cat ' hello ' | ls < "  xx infile!" randomfile > out        //tested and OK

THINGS THAT ARE EQUIVALENT:
< _testfile cat | wc -l > out			                                                //tested and OK
=
cat _testfile | wc -l > out			                                                    //tested and OK
=
cat < _testfile | wc -l > out			                                                    //tested and OK
=
"cat" < _testfile | "wc" -l > out                                                      //tested and OK


THINGS THAT DO NOT WORK IN BASH:
< _testfile | cat | wc -l > out		                 implemented too much
cat | wc -l < _testfile
cat | wc -l <_testfile > out
"cat" < _testfile | "wc -l" > out
"cat < _testfile" | "wc -l" > out
etc

THINGS THAT WORK:
ls > out			                                                                   //tested and OK
=
ls < _testfile > out            // _testfile ignored in that case			               //tested and OK

ls -l > out			               			               			                   //tested and OK
=
ls -l  < _testfile > out        // infile ignored in that case			               //tested and OK

cat < _testfile > out           //this works			                               //tested and OK

THINGS THAT DO NOT WORK IN BASH:
ls | > out
cat _testfile | out
