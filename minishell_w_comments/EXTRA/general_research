bash is the language that runs in most terminals
shell is the original bash (is also a language)
shell is one step above the kernel and tells the kernel what to do

echo $0         shows you which language you are running (f.e. /bin/zsh or bash)

____a shell works like this basically:
*print a prompt
*read a line
*parsing building a tree representation
* execute and loops back to print a prompt

____commands that you can give to a shell:
program_name -options filename          provide options to program
program_name < infile > outfile         (input/output redirection for stdin and stdout)
program_1 | program_2 | program_3       pipe output of one program into the input of another program
program_1 ; program_2 ; program_3       program sequencing to run program_2 as soon as program_1 complets
program_name &                          to run program in the background
(program_1 ; program_2) | program_3     parser also recognizes parenthesis to do grouping

_____
so for executing a program we have a
parsecmd - which is a recursive descent parser 
and a 
runcmd - which walks through the tree recursively
        and executes the nodes
        and creates a child process as required

Input is  sequence of tokens - (a token in that sense is one string in *argv[])
Idea is to make each cmd a node which has the command variables as subnodes
f.e. echo is the node and $PWD is the subnode
or cat is the node and myfile.txt is the subnode

when parsing we should check if the parsed string is/contains a
