grep "h" _testfile >> _testfile 
grep: _testfile: input file is also the output

echo $?

 PROBLEM with the following:
 env << out     the problem only occurs with builtins in connection to redirections

 ALSO:
 echo \"$SHELL\"-   the problem occurs when there is sth directly after the second "" 
                    => solution: during parsing, already remove the quotes and strjoin with the thing after the quotes until the next question mark
