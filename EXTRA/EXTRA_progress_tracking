TO DO:

- echo $"HOM"E$USER - in this case dollar sign should not be printed

- valgrind errors - f.e. for input_str = "echo "

- signals exit status

- echo $USER$TESTNOTFOUND$HOME$

- echo hi >./outfiles/outfile01 | echo bye

if i export TEST+=100, it is not an error, but the variable has to be TEST=100
